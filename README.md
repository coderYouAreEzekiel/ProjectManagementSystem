# Project Management System

`Project Management System` is a school-based project using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Back-end library, JS Modules). This project serves as the last activity in my school-year in Senior High School, it includes back-end library where we must create our own modules to function the website, Me and my partner developed this project in just 3-Days. I includes some features in this web project:

 ## FEATURES:
 `Login features` - I added this feature for dynamic and feels more similar to other `Project Manager Apps`. <br>
 `Adding Product Inventory` - I added this feature to check the item's quantity and when I dropped to 0 it will be `Out of stock`. <br>
 `Add/remove feature` - You can modify the quantity of a product in `"Inventory"`. <br>
 `Purchase feature` - By purchasing, the item will remove in the storage.

> ## CAUTION:
> ## This project only serves as the achievement we gained throughout the learning journey, You can "FORK" this reposity to modify or change the code.
